Spring Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Build Tools for Java ----> Maven (XML based pom) ✅ and Gradle (Groovy / Kotlin based)
Maven Build Tool is Compleley free

🔸Dependency Managemnet of 3rd party libraries
🔸Packing/Building into a single file (jar,war,zip)
🔸Automation
🔸Plugin Support
🔸Parent and Child project support using Maven modules
🔸Testing


To work with spring you need atleast 2 dependency
--------------------------------------------------------------------
🔸spring core
🔸spring context

Spring facilates
🔸DI(Dependency Injection)
🔸IOC (Inversion of Control)




	Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection) are two concepts that are related to each other.
	IoC is a principle that transfers the control of creating and managing objects to a container or framework, such as Spring.
	DI is a pattern that implements IoC by injecting the dependencies of an object through its constructor, setter methods, or fields.
	Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework.
	It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle.
	The Container uses DI to manage the components that make up the application123.
	
	
Some of the benefits of using Spring IoC and DI are:
🔸Decoupling the objects from their dependencies and making them easier to test and reuse
🔸Reducing the boilerplate code for creating and initializing objects
🔸Improving the modularity and flexibility of the application
🔸Allowing the application to be configurable through external metadata such as XML, Java annotations, or Java code

By default Spring follows Singelton pattern




SPRING JDBC


mysql> create table student(id int primary key, name varchar(100) not null,city varchar(200));



primary key ==> duplicate values not allowed  and no null values
 identifies every row distinctly
